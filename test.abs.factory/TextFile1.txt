Today I will be talking about abstract factory pattern, again this is another creational design pattern that lets you produce
families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

so for our problem, we will provide a solution on how a vehicle factory could produce a car, truck and motorcycle. again we wills start
by creating a unit test.

Recap,

Abstract Factory which is the interface IFactory

Concrete Factory which is the MotorcycleFactory, CarFactory and TruckFactory that produces specific products

Products which is the Motorcycle, Car and Truck classes.
