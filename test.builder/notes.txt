Good morning guys, today I will be introducing another creational design pattern, the builder pattern.

this pattern lets you construct complext objects step by step. the pattern allows you to produce different types
and representation of an object using the same construction code.

for our problem, we will dig deeper with our vehicle factory where we introduce the builder pattern to create
cars, motorcycle and truck. again we will be starting by creating unit test for our solution.

as for the conclusion,

we have create the follow classes.

Director - which refers to the VehicleBuilder class, this class
acts as a director which tells us which builder to use and
what actions we should do to create the required object.

Concrete Builder - this class constructs the concrete object, these are
MotorcycleBuilder, CarBuilder and TruckBuilder.

Product - which refers to Car, Truck and Motorcycle models.
