Today I will be introducing Factory Method Pattern.

Factory method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a base class or an abstract class or an interface which refers to 
as a superclass, and is inheritted by a subclass to alter the type of objects, methods that will be created.

So for our problem, we will try to solve or create a solution through Test Driven Design, which will solve a logistics problem that requires transport
by air, car, motorcycle or ship.
